Load Datasets
The dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), titled "U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Attributed to For-Hire Transportation Services (in billions of current USD)", provides an annual breakdown of the economic contributions made by for-hire transportation services to the U.S. GDP. For-hire transportation includes services like trucking, rail, water, air, and pipeline transportation provided by specialized companies rather than in-house transportation within other industries.

The data covers multiple decades and highlights the financial impact of these transportation services, showing trends in economic growth, fluctuations related to economic cycles, and the importance of transportation as a sector within the U.S. economy. This dataset is valuable for analyzing the role of transportation services in the overall economic landscape and understanding how external factors, such as policy changes or global events, may have influenced this sector over time.

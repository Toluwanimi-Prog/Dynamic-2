# Summary

As the total U.S. GDP has grown over the years—from $7,414.7 billion in 1995 to $25,462.7 billion in 2022—the For-Hire Transportation GDP has also increased, rising from $231.7 billion in 1995 to $815.0 billion in 2022. Despite this growth, the For-Hire Transportation sectors share of the total U.S. GDP has fluctuated between 2.7% and 3.7% during this period. This data indicates that while both the total U.S. GDP and the For-Hire Transportation GDP have expanded at a similar pace, the substantial increase in the For-Hire Transportation GDP over these 28 years has not directly driven the rise in the overall U.S. GDP. However, despite this, there remains a clear correlation between the Total U.S. GDP and the For-Hire Transportation GDP. The data reveals a positive relationship between these two variables: as the Total U.S. GDP increases, the For-Hire Transportation GDP rises as well.

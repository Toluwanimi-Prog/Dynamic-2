    "text": "8.1.1 Ozone Histogram\n\nThe Ozone histogram has its highest values on the left and then curbs off to the right, it indicates a right-skewed distribution.\nThis means:\n\nMost ozone values are low, with a few much higher values creating a long tail on the right.\nThe skewness could result from natural variability, pollution events, or weather conditions affecting ozone levels.\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Scatter Plot Ozone vs Temperature\n\n\nA scatter plot of ozone (x-axis) vs. temperature (y-axis) with a slight positive correlation means that higher ozone levels tend to be associated with higher temperatures. However, the relationship is weak, suggesting other factors (like wind, humidity, or pollution) also affect ozone levels and temperature.\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Pivot Table Average Ozones Per Day & Month (Redacted)\n\n\nThe pivot table presents daily sums for multiple variables (Temperature, Wind, Solar Radiation, and Ozone) over several months (May to September). The days with the highest ozone averages are Day 25 in May (with an Ozone value of 5-65) and July (with an Ozone value of 7-74), with other notable days being Day 29 and Day 30 in May. The months with the highest ozone levels are May, which shows several days with high averages, and July, particularly on Days 25 and 29.\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Pivot Chart Average Ozones Per Day & Month\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Pivot Table of Variation in Solar Radiation and Temperature\n\nThe pivot chart provide a visual representation of how these variables change over time. The histogram shows day-to-day variations in ozone levels, with the highest concentrations occurring in the summer months. Notably, there is a pronounced peak around July 25th, indicating exceptionally high ozone levels on that day. May and July both have elevated levels, with smaller peaks around May 29th and 30th, but July 25th stands out as the most significant. Overall, the chart confirms that ozone levels are highest in July, particularly around the 25th.\n\n\n\nThe pivot table shows daily sums for Solar Radiation and Temperature over a month. There is noticeable daily variation, with high values on days like 18, 19, and 29, indicating intense sunlight and warmer temperatures, and lower values on days like 23 and 27, reflecting cooler conditions. The grand totals summarize the entire month, with 20,513 for Solar Radiation and 8,635 for Temperature. Overall, the table captures daily fluctuations in weather conditions.\n\n\n\n8.1.6 Pivot Chart of Pivot Chart of Variation in Solar Radiation and Temperature\n\n\nThe bar chart shows daily sums of Solar Radiation (blue) and Temperature (orange) over 31 days. High Solar Radiation is notable on days like 9, 13, 16, 18, 19, and 29, with values exceeding 1,000. Temperature values are generally lower, mostly below 400, with higher values on days like 9 and 18. There are significant day-to-day variations, with some days showing high Solar Radiation but lower temperatures (e.g., Day 13). The chart captures daily fluctuations and highlights days with extreme values.\n\n\n\n8.1.7 Pivot Table\n\n\nThe pivot table displays the average temperature (Average of Temp) and ozone levels (Average of Ozone) for days labeled 5 to 9, showing average temperatures ranging from 66.46 to 83.88, with the highest temperatures recorded on days 7 and 8. Ozone levels vary significantly, from a low of 24.13 on Day 5 to a high of 60.00 on Day 8. Overall, the average temperature for the period is 77.79, and the average ozone level is 42.10, reflecting moderate temperatures with variable ozone levels across these days and highlighting daily fluctuations in both metrics.\n\n\n\n8.1.8 Pivot Chart\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the average temperature (in blue) and average ozone levels (in orange) for days 5 to 9, showing that temperatures remain relatively high throughout, ranging from around 66 on Day 5 to approximately 84 on Days 7 and 8. Ozone levels start low on Day 5 (around 24), rise significantly by Days 7 and 8 (around 59-60), and then decrease slightly on Day 9 (around 31). The chart suggests a potential correlation between higher temperatures and elevated ozone levels, as Days 7 and 8, which have the highest temperatures, also show the highest average ozone levels, indicating noticeable variability over the period.",

After doing the pivot table, select that pivot table and insert the pivot chart to create the visualization.\n\nFrom the pivot table and chart above, it shows that ozone levels appear to increase with higher temperature and solar radiation but decrease with higher wind speeds.\nNext, I’m going to provide another pivot table, that shows the average of ozone, temperature, Solar.

To do that, select again the first table, the one that was cleaned, then again select the pivot table and choose the create own pivot table.\nI select and drag ozone, temperature, Solar.

There are lots of data sets from NTL, which can be access through https://ntl.bts.gov/ntl. Then, I chose the Highway safety and click on the motor vehicle safety data.\nI’m interested in this one, because it is critical to understand trends in road safety, which is a major public concern. The data that I collect is from this link https://www.bts.gov/content/motor-vehicle-safety-data. Those data was calculated by U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. https://www.bts.gov/topics/national-transportation-statistics\nI need to rearrange the table to make it more clear, so I transpose the from row to column.\nThe variables that I’m using are the year, injured, crashes, and also vehicle. Those are the key variables that can be useful for my analysis and visualizations.\n1. Select the row and copy, then click transpose from row to column.\n2. Next, select the table that has been transpose to insert the histogram and scatter plot.\n\nFrom the histogram, we can look at the vehicle distribution.\nFrom the scatter plot, we can see the correlation of each crashes, injured, and vehicle yearly, and those three are very similar, so it shows that each have weak correlation coefficient values, which means that there is little to no linear relationship between those variable.\nNext is to make the pivot table, insert the pivot table and I’m going to make the year and the percentage of fatalities. Then, insert the pivot chart.\n\nFrom the pivot chart, it shows that there is a minimum fatalities percentage on the year 2011. The percentage of fatalities in that year reached its lowest point compared to other years in the data set. This suggests that fewer fatalities, as a proportion of the total relevant incidents or events, occurred in 2011 than in other years.\nI add another pivot table regarding the crashes versus the percentage of fatalities.\n\nAt first, my hypothesis was the higher number of crashes, the higher the percentage of fatalities would be. However, looking at the chart it is not true.\nThe lowest percentage of fatalities was when there were 5,377,289 crashes. The highest percentage of fatalities was when there were 6,159,350.",

For my analysis, I focused on key variables like the number of accidents, percentage of fatalities, and safety interventions over the years. One of the significant findings was the noticeable decrease in the percentage of fatalities, with a minimum observed in 2011. This suggests that factors such as improved vehicle safety features, stricter traffic laws, and public awareness campaigns during that period may have contributed to reducing fatalities.\nOverall, this project highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement of road safety measures. Analyzing such data can guide future strategies for reducing accidents and saving lives on the road.",

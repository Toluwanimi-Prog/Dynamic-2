This visualization helps quickly identify the kinds of events that have significantly impacted the transportation sector over the years.\nEvent Duration: The length of each horizontal bar shows the duration of each event:\nShort-Term Events (like specific policy implementations) have shorter bars, indicating a limited time impact.\nLong-Term Events (like the shale gas boom or supply chain disruptions) have longer bars, indicating they affected the transportation sector over multiple years.\nOverlapping Events: Look for events that occur around the same time. For example, if a fuel price surge coincides with a global event (like the COVID-19 pandemic), it may indicate a compounded effect on the transportation sector during that period. Overlapping policy changes and fuel-related events (such as the 2012 MAP-21 Act and low oil prices in 2015) could suggest a favorable environment for sector growth or cost reduction.\nMajor Disruptions: The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent supply chain disruptions in 2021-2022 stand out, as they span multiple categories (global events, policy responses) and have broad implications across transportation modes.\nTrends by Type: Fuel-Related Events: Periodic spikes and drops in fuel prices (2005-2008, 2015, 2022) indicate volatility that directly affects transportation costs.\nPolicy Events: Regulatory changes and infrastructure investments, like the FMCSA Safety Regulations (2010) and the Infrastructure Act (2021), tend to support long-term improvements but may come with short-term compliance costs.\nGlobal Events: Economic downturns (2009 financial crisis) and the COVID-19 pandemic have had significant impacts, shown by bars for 2009 and 2020, signaling major demand shocks or disruptions.\nOverall Insights: The Gantt-style timeline provides a broad overview of the external pressures and opportunities the transportation sector has faced. By analyzing the interaction between fuel volatility, policy changes, and global disruptions, you can better understand how these factors shape sector trends and resilience. This visual will make it easier to discuss how specific types of external factors impact transportation modes differently and the sector’s response to multi-year trends.",

Transportation GDP\nTo understand the shifting dominance of each sector within the transportation GDP, we’ll create a stacked area chart showing each sector’s contribution as a percentage over time.\n\n\n9.2.0.8 5.1 Prepare Data for Percentage Contribution Plot\nWe’ll reshape the data to focus on each sector’s percentage contribution to total For-Hire Transportation GDP.\n\n# Select and

sectors like trucking and air transport grew in their GDP contributions over time. We can explain trends here, such as the effect of deregulation on trucking and how e-commerce drove an increase in demand for both trucking and warehousing.```\n\n\n9.2.0.10 Step 6: Interactive Timeline with GDP and Major Events\nThis visualization combines GDP data with significant events, allowing for an interactive examination of how external factors align with GDP trend\n\n\n9.2.0.11 6.1 Prepare the Interactive Plotly Timeline Data\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Create interactive timeline with plotly\ntimeline_plot &lt;- plot_ly(\n  data = timeline_data,\n  x = ~Year,\n  y = ~0,  # Keep all events on the same y-axis level for a horizontal timeline\n  type = \"scatter\",\n  mode = \"markers+text\",\n  text = ~paste0(\"Event: \", Event, \"&lt;br&gt;Description: \", Description, \"&lt;br&gt;Category: \", Category),\n  hoverinfo = \"text\",\n  marker = list(size = 10),\n  color = ~Category,\n  colors = category_colors\n) %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Interactive Timeline of Major External Factors Affecting the U.S. Transportation Sector\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Year\", tickmode = \"linear\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"\", showticklabels = FALSE),\n    hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = \"white\", font = list(size = 12)),\n    showlegend = TRUE\n  )\n\n# Display the plot\ntimeline_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation: This timeline allows users to interactively explore the events and see their descriptions and categories. Key events such as the 2008 Recession or COVID-19 Pandemic are marked to show their effects on the transportation GDP, with implications such as temporary drops in freight and changes in sectoral growth patterns``\n\n\n9.2.0.12 Step 7: Drafting the Impact Analysis\n\nTimeline of Major External Events:\n\n\nImpact of Policies: Deregulation policies like the Motor Carrier Act (1980) and Staggers Rail Act (1980) reduced costs and increased competition, leading to a growth boost in trucking and rail sectors.\nTechnological Advances: The rise of e-commerce in the 2000s, coupled with advances in logistics, significantly increased trucking’s share of GDP, as it became essential for last-mile delivery.\nEconomic Crises: The 2008 Recession and COVID-19 Pandemic caused temporary drops in GDP, affecting the transportation sector due to reduced demand.\n\n\nTotal GDP vs. Transportation GDP:\n\n\nOverall Trend: Total GDP has grown at a faster rate than transportation GDP, especially in the 2000s, with technology, finance, and healthcare leading economic growth.\nPolicy Correlation: Transportation GDP saw significant upticks after deregulation in the 1980s and as trade agreements like NAFTA (1994) increased demand for trucking and rail transport.\nExplanation of Fluctuations: Highlight inflection points, like the 2008 recession, to show how economic events affect transportation differently than other sectors.\n\n\nSector-Specific Trends:\n\n\nTrucking: Deregulation and the rise of e-commerce in the 2000s significantly benefited trucking. Continued infrastructure investments have also strengthened trucking as the primary mode of goods distribution.\nAir Transport: Growth in global trade and support for air cargo infrastructure made air transportation crucial for high-value and time-sensitive goods.\nRail and Water: Despite deregulation, rail and water transport have seen slower growth due to competition from trucking and air, particularly for shorter regional hauls.\n\n4.Sector Contribution as a Percentage:\n\nTrucking’s Dominance: Over the years, trucking’s share of transportation GDP has increased, supported by infrastructure investments and the logistics demands of e-commerce.\nSteady Contributions of Other Sectors: Sectors like rail and water transport remain stable due to specialized uses and regulatory constraints, while air transport has grown in response to global trade demands.\n\n\nFuture Implications:\n\n\nPolicy: Current infrastructure investments (e.g., Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) will likely enhance trucking, rail, and water transport efficiencies.\nTechnology: Advances in automation and electric vehicles will shape the future of transportation GDP, especially as environmental policies favor cleaner modes.",

Correlation Analysis Between For-Hire Transportation GDP & Total U.S. GDP\nAs the total U.S. GDP has grown over the years—from $7,414.7 billion in 1995 to $25,462.7 billion in 2022—the For-Hire Transportation GDP has also increased, rising from $231.7 billion in 1995 to $815.0 billion in 2022. Despite this growth, the For-Hire Transportation sectors share of the total U.S. GDP has fluctuated between 2.7% and 3.7% during this period. This data indicates that while both the total U.S. GDP and the For-Hire Transportation GDP have expanded at a similar pace, the substantial increase in the For-Hire Transportation GDP over these 28 years has not directly driven the rise in the overall U.S. GDP. However, despite this, there remains a clear correlation between the Total U.S. GDP and the For-Hire Transportation GDP.

The main focuses of the Transportation GDP that the data set explores are personal consumption, private domestic investment, exports, imports, and government-transportation related purchases. The data shows how much of each of these separate sections spend or contribute to the GDP of the US in a dollar amount (billions of $).\n\n\n7.3.2 Summary\nFrom the data set, we can see that personal contribution is the highest section that contributes to the total GDP of transportation in the US. We can also see that Imports generates more GDP than exports does.

Plot shows a general increase in the total GDP of for-hire transportation gdp of different sectors over time. We can see that the all sectors gace grown gdps over the decades, some winning out more than others. We see initially that the total gdp for all sectors sits well under 200 Billion and for the next 40 years grows by a factor of over 4X. The sector of for-hire that has grown the most over the period of this analysis is the Trucking sector. Followed by Other. We cab see that during the pandemic, Air lost a considerable market share and lost it’s momentum that previously looked like it would get carried by to become a leader amongst all the sectors. This decline makes sense as air travel was not permitted/heavily regulate/discrouraged during the pandameic. We can also see that warehousing is making considerable strides in gdp growth over the past decade. ## Week 3 # Load Libraries",

We can see that the all sectors gace grown gdps over the decades, some winning out more than others. We see initially that the total gdp for all sectors sits well under 200 Billion and for the next 40 years grows by a factor of over 4X. The sector of for-hire that has grown the most over the period of this analysis is the Trucking sector. Followed by Other. We cab see that during the pandemic, Air lost a considerable market share and lost it’s momentum that previously looked like it would get carried by to become a leader amongst all the sectors. This decline makes sense as air travel was not permitted/heavily regulate/discrouraged during the pandameic. We can also see that warehousing is making considerable strides in gdp growth over the past decade.\n\n# Calculate sector percentages for each year\ntransport_long_pct &lt;- transport_long %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percent_GDP = GDP / sum(GDP) * 100)\n\n# Create stacked bar chart with sector percentages for all years\np3 &lt;- ggplot(transport_long_pct, aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = Percent_GDP, fill = Sector)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of For-hire Transportation GDP by Sector (1980-2022)\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage of Total GDP\",\n       fill = \"Transportation Sector\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = function(x) x[seq(1, length(x), by = 2)])\n\n# Create filtered version showing only decade intervals with percentages\ntransport_long_pct_filtered &lt;- transport_long_pct %&gt;%\n  filter(Year %in% seq(1980, 2022, by = 10))\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(transport_long_pct_filtered, aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = Percent_GDP, fill = Sector)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of For-hire Transportation GDP by Sector (Decade Intervals)\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage of Total GDP\",\n       fill = \"Transportation Sector\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 37),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.3),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n# Display the percentage plots\np3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Analyze the sectors with the highest growth\ngrowth_analysis &lt;- transport_long_pct %&gt;%\n  group_by(Sector) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Growth = Percent_GDP[Year == \"2022\"] - Percent_GDP[Year == \"1980\"]) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Growth))\n\nprint(\"Growth Analysis by Sector:\")\n\n[1] \"Growth Analysis by Sector:\"\n\ngrowth_analysis\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n  Sector        Growth\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Warehousing   7.58  \n2 Other         4.05  \n3 Air           2.02  \n4 Pipeline      0.982 \n5 Transit       0.644 \n6 Truck         0.0924\n7 Water        -1.17  \n8 Rail        -14.2   \n\n\nThis bar chart displays the percentage distribution of for-hire transportation GDP by sector from 1980 to 2022.

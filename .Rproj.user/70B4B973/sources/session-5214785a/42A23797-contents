### Context of the Dataset

-   **Title**: Warehouse and Retail Sales
-   **Link**: [Download the CSV dataset](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/api/views/v76h-r7br/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD)

The *Warehouse and Retail Sales* dataset provides a comprehensive view of sales activities in Montgomery County, Maryland, by capturing data from various warehouse and retail operations. This dataset was collected through a combination of direct reporting from businesses, automated sales tracking systems, and regional sales surveys. The data encompasses a range of sales metrics, including volume and product categories, to offer insights into business performance across different types of establishments.

The dataset includes the following variables:

-   Row Labels: Categories or identifiers used to organize and classify the sales data.
-   BEER: Sales volume for beer products.
-   DUNNAGE: Sales volume for dunnage products, which are materials used to protect goods during transportation.
-   KEGS: Sales volume for kegs, typically used for storing and transporting beverages.
-   LIQUOR: Sales volume for liquor products.
-   NON-ALCOHOL: Sales volume for non-alcoholic beverages.
-   REF: Sales volume for refrigeration supplies or products.
-   STR_SUPPLIES: Sales volume for store supplies, which may include various retail essentials.
-   WINE: Sales volume for wine products.
-   Grand Total: The total sales volume across all categories combined.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

1.  **Import the Data**: I downloaded and loaded the CSV file into Excel.
2.  **Check for Missing Values**: My preferred method for handling NAs is by highlighting them and deselecting them using the filter tool for each column as I feel most thorough by doing that. Using the following steps "Select the entire dataset, go to Home \> Conditional Formatting \> Highlight Cells Rules \> Blanks to highlight all blank cells."
3.  **Data Formatting**: Formated any columns that need specific data types (such as dates as date format, numbers as currency or percentage).

-   Specifically I used the =TEXTJOIN("-", TRUE, A2, B2) function to join column one (YYYY) and column two (MM) into a new column called TIME

### Visualization

**Pivot Tables YT link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-AK0Hv0b4

-   Pivot tables are a powerful and user friendly (drag and drop) summary statistic/visualisation tool that I used to get an intial feel of my data.

Here are the findings:

**Warehouse Sales/Expenses of Beverages Over Time (2017 - 2020)**

![](pivot_table_baruga.png)

-   **Overall Sales**: ***BEER*** has the highest sales, followed by ***WINE***, while ***DUNNAGE***, ***REF***, and ***STR_SUPPLIES*** have negative or minimal sales, which makes sense as refers to materials used to protect goods during shipping and handling, such as packing materials or cushioning, and as such is an expense to the business leading to its negative output on revenue.
-   **Monthly Trends**: ***BEER*** sales vary significantly, with large peaks and drops. ***WINE*** sales are more stable but still show some fluctuation. ***KEGS*** and ***LIQUOR*** show positive but lower sales.

**Histogram of Warehouse Sales/Expenses of Beverages Over Time**

-   Here is a histogram representation of the aforementioned summary pivot tables. There appears to be a disporportionate amount of ***BEER*** bought for warehouses. But that could be due to the fact that beers are sold in packs and so single unit quantity has skyrocketed in order to make a "12 pack" that will later count as one unit sold at retail.

**Retail Sales of Beverages Over Time (2017 - 2020)**

![](pivot2_table.png)

-   **Product Types**: Includes Beer, Liquor, Wine, Non-Alcoholic beverages, and others, with substantial sales figures for Beer, Liquor, and Wine.
-   **Sales Trends**: Liquor leads with \$802,691.43 in total sales, followed by Wine (\$746,498.59) and Beer (\$574,220.53). Recent months show higher sales for Beer and Wine.
-   **Low Sales Categories**: Items like Dunnage and Kegs have negligible or zero sales.
-   **Overall Total**: Total sales across all products amount to \$2,160,899.37, highlighting overall retail activity.

**Histogram of Retail Sales of Beverages Over Time**

-   Once we come to the retail side of things we see that ***WINE*** and ***LIQUOR*** are clear best sellers. It is shown hower that ***LIQUOR*** has begun to overtake ***WINE*** in retail sales.

### Summary

From the "Warehouse and Retail Sales" dataset, I found that Beer leads in warehouse sales, with notable fluctuations due to bulk packaging, while Wine and Liquor have more stable sales. Retail sales show Liquor as the top seller, recently surpassing Wine, with Beer also performing strongly but declining. The histograms illustrate high Beer volume in warehouses and a shift in retail dominance from Wine to Liquor. Next, I will analyze seasonal trends, create advanced visualizations for deeper insights, and finalize the report with comprehensive findings and recommendations.

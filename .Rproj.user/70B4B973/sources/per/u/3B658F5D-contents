**Monday Tableau Public Tutorial**

**Importing the Dataset**

1. Open Tableau and go to File > Open to upload the "Diamonds Dataset (ggplot2).csv."
2. Alternatively, you can connect to a Text File from the Connect Pane on the left side of the Tableau interface and select the CSV file.

2. Check for Missing Values
In Tableau, there isnâ€™t a direct way to highlight missing values during import. However, you can check for them by creating calculated fields or visually scanning the dataset:

**Step-by-Step:
Drag the fields (e.g., Price, Carat, Cut, etc.) onto the Rows or Columns shelf to create a summary table.
Tableau automatically handles missing values, but to check for them:
Go to a new worksheet.
Create a Calculated Field:
Name it MissingValuesCheck.
Use the formula:
scss
Copy code
IFNULL([FieldName], "Missing")
Replace FieldName with the actual field name you want to check.
Apply this calculated field and observe if there are any "Missing" labels.

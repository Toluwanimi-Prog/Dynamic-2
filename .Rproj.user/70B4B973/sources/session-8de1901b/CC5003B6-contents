**September 4 2024**

During class today, we learnt about how to create pivot tables using excel and how best to properly present our data to convey the information we found accurately.

**Data Description/Selection**
By using the air-quality dataset, which contains air quality measurements collected from May to September 1973 in New York united states of America. This dataset includes:

-   **Ozone**
-   **Solar.R** (solar radiation)
-   **Wind** (wind speed in mph)
-   **Temp** (temperature in Fahrenheit)
-   **Month** (May to September)
-   **Day** (1 to 31)

**Source**
**1.Open the Dataset:**
The data were sourced from the New York State Department of Conservation (for ozone data) and the National Weather Service (for meteorological data).
I obtained an updated version of the airquality.csv file

**2.Identify and Address Missing Values:**

**Data Cleaning Process: Fill or Remove Missing Values:**

I cleaned the dataset using Excel by removing rows with missing values (NA) and performed exploratory analysis to reveal patterns and trends in ozone levels and other variables.

**Variables to be evaluated
** In this dataset,i will be using the Temperature and ozone

**Step 2:Creating a PivotTable**

I selected the entire dataset using Ctrl+A, then went to the Insert tab and clicked on PivotTable. I chose to place the PivotTable in a New Worksheet and clicked OK. To set it up, I dragged Month to the Rows area, Day to the Columns area, and Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp to the Values area. I made sure each value displayed as an Average by clicking the dropdown next to each field in the Values area, selecting Value Field Settings, and choosing Average. Finally, I customized the PivotTable's design using the Design tab and adjusted the number formatting by right-clicking on the data cells.

**Step 3:Creating Visualizations**
**Insert a PivotChart and Customize the Chart:**
I clicked inside the PivotTable, then went to the Insert tab and selected PivotChart. I chose the chart type that best suited my data, like a Line Chart for trends or a Bar Chart for comparisons, and clicked OK. To customize the chart, I used the Chart Tools to adjust the design, layout, and format, and added essential elements such as titles, axis labels, and legends to enhance readability.

**Step 4: Experiment with Different Configurations**

I clicked inside the PivotTable, then went to the Insert tab and selected PivotChart. I chose the chart type that best suited my data, like a Line Chart for trends or a Bar Chart for comparisons, and clicked OK. To customize the chart, I used the Chart Tools to adjust the design, layout, and format, and added essential elements such as titles, axis labels, and legends to enhance readability.

**Ozone Histogram**

The Ozone distribution shows a right-skewed pattern, indicating that most values are low, with a few high outliers. This could reflect variations in weather or pollution.

**Scatter Plot: Ozone vs Temperature**

![](scatter_ozone_vs_temp_toluwanimi.png)

There is a weak positive correlation between ozone and temperature, suggesting that higher temperatures tend to coincide with higher ozone levels, though other factors like wind or pollution likely contribute.

**Average Ozone Per Day & Month**

The highest ozone averages occur on May 25th and July 25th, with notable peaks also on May 29th and July 30th. July generally exhibits higher ozone levels, especially around the end of the month.

**Solar Radiation and Temperature Variations**

The chart reveals daily variations in solar radiation and temperature, peaking around days 18, 19, and 29. Both solar radiation and temperature are higher on these days, pointing to intense sunlight and warmth during these periods.


**Conclusion**

After setting up the PivotTable by selecting the dataset and placing it in a new worksheet, I configured it with Month in the Rows, Day in the Columns, and used Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp, showing their averages in the Values area. I tweaked the design and number formatting to make it look cleaner. Then, I inserted a PivotChart based on the table, chose the best chart type for my data, and added titles and labels for clarity. To wrap it up, I explored different configurations by switching variables around, like moving Temp to the Axis and Average Ozone to the Values, to see which setup gave the best visual insight into my data. This process helped me organize and present the information in a clear, visually appealing way

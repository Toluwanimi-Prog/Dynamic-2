**Monday Tableu Tutorial**

In Monday’s class, we learned how to use Tableau Public, first download and install it. We used the web version, then learnt how to import the dataset (airquality_datasets.csv), Next time we cleaned the data by checking for missing values and renaming columns.

**Importing the Dataset**:After Opening Tableau Public,I clicked on “Connect to Data,” then select “Text File,” and navigate to the dataset (airquality_datasets.csv).Then clicked “Open” or drag and drop the file.

**Visualization**
Next, we created visualizations:

**Bar Chart for Average Ozone Levels by Month**: We dragged 'Month' to Rows and 'Ozone' to Columns, then aggregated Ozone as an average. If Tableau didn't automatically create a bar chart, we changed the Marks type to Bar. We also renamed the sheet tab.

**Line Chart for Ozone Levels Over Days**: In a new worksheet, we dragged 'Day' to Columns and 'Ozone' to Rows, creating a line chart, and explored properties like color.

**Scatter Plot for Temperature vs. Ozone**: We created a new worksheet, dragged 'Temp' to Columns and 'Ozone' to Rows. If Tableau defaulted to a Measure, we changed each pill to Dimension. If not showing a scatter plot, we selected Shape in the Marks tab. Map Visualization: Since our dataset didn’t include geographical data like Latitude and Longitude, we skipped this step.

**Creating a Pivot Table**: In a new worksheet, we dragged 'Month' to Rows, 'Day' to Columns, 'Ozone' to Color, and 'Ozone' to Size. We observed the resulting pivot table and experimented with the added dimensions.

**Building a Dashboard**: We clicked on the New Dashboard button, dragged and dropped our created sheets onto the dashboard area, arranged them cohesively, and added interactivity using filters and actions. We reviewed the ozone vs. day line plot and considered improvements or fixes.

**Conclusion**
-In this Class, we gained hands-on experience with Tableau Public, from importing and cleaning data to creating a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and pivot tables. We also learned how to build interactive dashboards to present our findings in a cohesive way. These skills will be useful for analyzing and visualizing complex datasets, making it easier to draw insights and communicate results effectively

**September 4 2024**

During class today, we learnt about how to create pivot tables using excel and how best to properly present our data to convey the information we found accurately.

**Data Description/Selection**

I am using the air-quality dataset, which contains air quality measurements collected from May to September 1973 in New York united states of America. This dataset includes:

-   **Ozone**
-   **Solar.R** (solar radiation)
-   **Wind** (wind speed in mph)
-   **Temp** (temperature in Fahrenheit)
-   **Month** (May to September)
-   **Day** (1 to 31)

**Source**

The data were sourced from the New York State Department of Conservation (for ozone data) and the National Weather Service (for meteorological data).

**Data Cleaning Process**

I cleaned the dataset using Excel by removing rows with missing values (NA) and performed exploratory analysis to reveal patterns and trends in ozone levels and other variables.

**Variables to be evaluated** In this dataset,i will be using the Temperature and ozone

**Ozone Histogram**

The Ozone distribution shows a right-skewed pattern, indicating that most values are low, with a few high outliers. This could reflect variations in weather or pollution.

**Scatter Plot: Ozone vs Temperature**

![](scatter_ozone_vs_temp_toluwanimi.png)

There is a weak positive correlation between ozone and temperature, suggesting that higher temperatures tend to coincide with higher ozone levels, though other factors like wind or pollution likely contribute.

**Average Ozone Per Day & Month**

![](pivot4_table_toluwanimi.png)

The highest ozone averages occur on May 25th and July 25th, with notable peaks also on May 29th and July 30th. July generally exhibits higher ozone levels, especially around the end of the month.

**Solar Radiation and Temperature Variations**

![](pivot1_chart_toluwanimi.png)

The chart reveals daily variations in solar radiation and temperature, peaking around days 18, 19, and 29. Both solar radiation and temperature are higher on these days, pointing to intense sunlight and warmth during these periods.

**September 4 2024**

During class today, we learnt about how to create pivot tables using exceland how best to properly present our data to convey the iformation we found accurately.

**Data Description/Selection**

I am using the air-quality dataset, which contains air quality measurements collected from May to September 1973  in New York united states of America. This dataset includes:

-   **Ozone**
-   **Solar.R** (solar radiation)
-   **Wind** (wind speed in mph)
-   **Temp** (temperature in Fahrenheit)
-   **Month** (May to September)
-   **Day** (1 to 31)

**Source**

The data were sourced from the New York State Department of Conservation (for ozone data) and the National Weather Service (for meteorological data).

**Data Cleaning Process**

I cleaned the dataset using Excel by removing rows with missing values (NA) and performed exploratory analysis to reveal patterns and trends in ozone levels and other variables.

**Variables to be evaluated**
In this dataset,i will be using the Temperature and ozone

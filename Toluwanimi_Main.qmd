**Monday Tableau Tutorial**

**Monday September 9, 2024**

In Monday’s class, we learned how to use Tableau Public. We began by downloading and installing the software or using the web version. We then imported the dataset (airquality_datasets.csv) and cleaned the data by checking for missing values and renaming columns.

Importing the Dataset: After opening Tableau Public, I clicked on “Connect to Data,” selected “Text File,” and navigated to the dataset (airquality_datasets.csv). Then I clicked “Open” or dragged and dropped the file.

**Visualization:**

**Bar Chart for Average Ozone Levels by Month:** We dragged 'Month' to Rows and 'Ozone' to Columns, then aggregated Ozone as an average. If Tableau didn't automatically create a bar chart, we changed the Marks type to Bar and renamed the sheet tab. Line Chart for Ozone Levels Over Days: In a new worksheet, we dragged 'Day' to Columns and 'Ozone' to Rows, creating a line chart, and explored properties like color. **Scatter Plot for Temperature vs. Ozone**: We created a new worksheet, dragged 'Temp' to Columns and 'Ozone' to Rows. If Tableau defaulted to a Measure, we changed each pill to Dimension. If not showing a scatter plot, we selected Shape in the Marks tab. Map Visualization: Since our dataset didn’t include geographical data like Latitude and Longitude, we skipped this step.

**Creating a Pivot Table:** In a new worksheet, we dragged 'Month' to Rows, 'Day' to Columns, 'Ozone' to Color, and 'Ozone' to Size. We observed the resulting pivot table and experimented with the added dimensions.

**Building a Dashboard:** We clicked on the New Dashboard button, dragged and dropped our created sheets onto the dashboard area, arranged them cohesively, and added interactivity using filters and actions. We reviewed the ozone vs. day line plot and considered improvements or fixes.\

**Conclusion**

In this class , we gained hands-on experience with Tableau Public, from importing and cleaning data to creating a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and pivot tables. We also learned how to build interactive dashboards to present our findings in a cohesive way. These skills will be useful for analyzing and visualizing complex datasets, making it easier to draw insights and communicate results effectively.






**Monday Diamond Tableau Tutorial**

September 9, 2024

**Introduction** The Diamonds dataset is widely used for statistical analysis and data visualization, providing information about various attributes of over 50,000 diamonds, such as their carat weight, cut quality, clarity, and price. The aim of this assignment is to clean the dataset, check for any missing values, and create meaningful visualizations using Tableau

**Importing the Dataset:**

Steps to Import the Dataset:

Opened Tableau and go to File \> Open to upload the "Diamonds Dataset (ggplot2).csv."

Navigate to File \> Open and select the diamonds_ggplot2.csv file to import the data.

**Cleaning the Dataset** The data set does not have any missing values, but i ensured all the data types are correct. **Ensure Data Types Are Correct:** Carat: Number (decimal) Cut: String Color: String Clarity: String Depth, Table, Price, X, Y, Z: Numbers

**Creating Visualizations**

**1. Bar Chart: Average Price by Cut** To explore how diamond prices vary based on their cut quality, I created a bar chart showing the average price for each cut category This chart will show how the average price varies based on the cut quality of the diamonds.

**Steps I Followed:** 1.I dragged Cut to the Rows shelf. 2.Then, I dragged Price to the Columns shelf. 3.To see the average price instead of the sum, I right-clicked on Price, selected Measure, and changed it to Average.

This gave me a clear view of how diamonds with different cut qualities (Ideal, Premium, etc.) are priced on average.

**2.Line Chart: Price Over Carat** Next, I wanted to see how the price changes as the carat size increases, so I built a line chart for this.

**Steps I Followed:** 1.I dragged Carat to the Columns shelf. 2.Then, I dragged Price to the Rows shelf. 3.To adjust the chart type to a line, I switched the chart type to Line from the Marks card.

This line chart helped me visualize how diamonds with larger carat weights tend to have higher prices, showing a clear upward trend.

![](Line%20Chart_Price%20Over%20Carat.png)

**3. Scatter Plot: Price vs. Carat** To get a more detailed look at the relationship between carat weight and price, I created a scatter plot. This allowed me to see the individual diamond data points more clearly.

**Steps I Followed:** 1.I dragged Carat to the Columns shelf. 2.Then, I dragged Price to the Rows shelf.

This generated a scatter plot that gave me a more granular view of how price is influenced by carat size. The scatter plot revealed the spread of data, showing how prices vary widely for diamonds of similar carat weights.

![](ScatterPlot_Price%20Over%20Carat.png)

**Creating a Pivot Table** After visualizing the data, I wanted to summarize the diamond prices across different cut and color combinations, so I built a pivot table.

**Steps I Followed:** 1.I dragged Cut to the Rows shelf. 2.Then, I dragged Color to the Columns shelf. 3.Finally, I dragged Price to Text (or Label) to display the prices. 4.I right-clicked on Price and summarized it by Average to show the average price for each combination of cut and color This pivot table allowed me to easily compare prices across various cut and color categories.

![](Pivot_Table.png)

**Conclusion** Through this assignment, I was able to successfully import, clean, and analyze the Diamonds dataset. By ensuring the data was properly cleaned and validated, I created several visualizations, including a bar chart, line chart, and scatter plot. Each provided valuable insights into how different attributes like cut and carat size influence diamond prices. Additionally, I summarized the data using a pivot table, which made it easy to see price variations across different cut and color combinations. Tableau’s flexibility allowed me to explore the dataset interactively, giving me a deeper understanding of the relationships within the data

### Week 1

### Week 2

**September 4 2024**

During class today, we learnt about how to create pivot tables using excel and how best to properly present our data to convey the information we found accurately.

**Data Description/Selection** By using the air-quality dataset, which contains air quality measurements collected from May to September 1973 in New York united states of America. This dataset includes:

-   **Ozone**
-   **Solar.R** (solar radiation)
-   **Wind** (wind speed in mph)
-   **Temp** (temperature in Fahrenheit)
-   **Month** (May to September)
-   **Day** (1 to 31)

**Source**

**1.Open the Dataset:** The data were sourced from the New York State Department of Conservation (for ozone data) and the National Weather Service (for meteorological data). I obtained an updated version of the airquality.csv file

**2.Identify and Address Missing Values:**

**Data Cleaning Process: Fill or Remove Missing Values:**

I cleaned the dataset using Excel by removing rows with missing values (NA) and performed exploratory analysis to reveal patterns and trends in ozone levels and other variables.

**Variables to be evaluated** In this dataset,i will be using the Temperature and ozone

**Step 2:Creating a PivotTable**

I selected the entire dataset using Ctrl+A, then went to the Insert tab and clicked on PivotTable. I chose to place the PivotTable in a New Worksheet and clicked OK. To set it up, I dragged Month to the Rows area, Day to the Columns area, and Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp to the Values area. I made sure each value displayed as an Average by clicking the dropdown next to each field in the Values area, selecting Value Field Settings, and choosing Average. Finally, I customized the PivotTable's design using the Design tab and adjusted the number formatting by right-clicking on the data cells.

**Step 4: Experiment with Different Configurations**

I clicked inside the PivotTable, then went to the Insert tab and selected PivotChart. I chose the chart type that best suited my data, like a Line Chart for trends or a Bar Chart for comparisons, and clicked OK. To customize the chart, I used the Chart Tools to adjust the design, layout, and format, and added essential elements such as titles, axis labels, and legends to enhance readability.

**Ozone Histogram**

![](hist_ozone_toluwanimi.png)

The Ozone distribution shows a right-skewed pattern, indicating that most values are low, with a few high outliers. This could reflect variations in weather or pollution.

**Scatter Plot: Ozone vs Temperature**

![](scatter_ozone_vs_temp_toluwanimi.png)

There is a weak positive correlation between ozone and temperature, suggesting that higher temperatures tend to coincide with higher ozone levels, though other factors like wind or pollution likely contribute.

**Average Ozone Per Day & Month**

![](pivot4_table_toluwanimi.png)

The highest ozone averages occur on May 25th and July 25th, with notable peaks also on May 29th and July 30th. July generally exhibits higher ozone levels, especially around the end of the month.

**Solar Radiation and Temperature Variations**

![](pivot1_chart_toluwanimi.png)

The chart reveals daily variations in solar radiation and temperature, peaking around days 18, 19, and 29. Both solar radiation and temperature are higher on these days, pointing to intense sunlight and warmth during these periods.

**Conclusion**

After setting up the PivotTable by selecting the dataset and placing it in a new worksheet, I configured it with Month in the Rows, Day in the Columns, and used Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp, showing their averages in the Values area. I tweaked the design and number formatting to make it look cleaner. Then, I inserted a PivotChart based on the table, chose the best chart type for my data, and added titles and labels for clarity. To wrap it up, I explored different configurations by switching variables around, like moving Temp to the Axis and Average Ozone to the Values, to see which setup gave the best visual insight into my data. This process helped me organize and present the information in a clear, visually appealing way.

### Week 3

**Wednesday Advanced Tableau Public Tutorial**

**September 11,2024**

In Wednesday's class, we learned how to implement what was learnt in Tableau Public on Monday at a more advanced level. We began by opening the Tableau public website.

**Importing the Dataset**:We then imported the dataset (diamonds_ggplot2_datasets.csv) and cleaned the data by checking for missing values and renaming columns.There weren't any missing data and NA in the dataset. After opening Tableau Public, I clicked on “Connect to Data,” selected “Text File,” and navigated to the dataset (diamonds_ggplot2_datasets.csv). Then I clicked “Open” or dragged and dropped the file.

**Calculated Fields**

To enhance my analysis skills, I created a new calculated field in Tableau Public. First, I navigated to Sheet 1, then from the top menu, I selected Analysis and clicked on Create Calculated Field. In the dialog box that appeared, I named the new field Price per Carat. To calculate this, I used the formula \[Price\] / \[Carat\]. After entering the formula, I clicked OK, and the new field was added to my dataset, allowing me to view price per carat for each diamond

![](Calculated%20field%20_%20Price_Per_Carat%20_%20Olufawo.png)

**2.Advanced Chart Types**

Next, I created an advanced chart type, a boxplot, to explore the distribution of diamond prices based on their cut quality. To do this, I first dragged Price to the Rows section and Cut to the Columns section. Then, I opened the Show Me panel on the right side and selected Box Plot. To ensure that the price was treated as a discrete variable, I right-clicked on Price and chose Dimension. To visually distinguish between the different cut categories, I also dragged Cut to the Color shelf. This boxplot now allows me to hover over each category to see details about the price distribution for each cut.

![](Dimension_%20Boxplot_Price_per_Cut_Olufawo.png)

**3. Dual-Axis Charts**

To compare Price and Carat on a dual-axis chart, I began by dragging Cut to the Columns section. Then, I added Price to the Rows, followed by Carat just below it. Afterward, I right-clicked on the Carat axis and chose Dual-Axis to overlay the two measures on the same chart. To ensure both axes were aligned properly, I right-clicked the axis again and selected Synchronize Axis. Finally, I adjusted the Marks card from Automatic to Line, which allowed me to visualize the relationship between diamond prices and carat weight in a more coherent manner.

![](Step2_Dual_Axis_Chart_Price_Per_Carat%20_Olufawo.png)

**4. Using Parameters**

To dynamically filter my dataset based on price, I created a parameter that allows for flexible threshold adjustments. First, I right-clicked in the Data pane and selected Create Parameter. I named it Price Threshold, set the data type to Float, and chose a default value of 500. After clicking OK, I right-clicked the parameter again in the Data pane and chose Show Parameter Control to make it visible on the dashboard.

![](Step1_Creating_Parameters_Olufawo.png)

Next, I created a calculated field by right-clicking in the Data pane and selecting Create Calculated Field. I named this field Price Greater than Threshold, with the formula \[Price\] \> \[Price Threshold\]. After clicking OK, I applied this calculated field as a filter by dragging it to the Filters shelf. In the Filter Field dialog, I selected True to display only records where the price exceeded the threshold. This setup allows the plot to dynamically update as I adjust the price threshold using the parameter.

**Creating an Interactive Dashboard with Actions**

To make my dashboard both visually appealing and interactive, I began by dragging and dropping the relevant sheets onto the dashboard to showcase my visualizations. I arranged the sheets thoughtfully to ensure the data story was clear and engaging.

Next, I added a Filter Action to make the dashboard responsive. I went to the top menu, selected Dashboard, and clicked on Actions. From there, I chose Add Action -\> Filter. In the dialog box, I defined the source sheet, which would act as the filter, and the target sheets, which would be filtered based on the selection. I fine-tuned the settings by choosing the filtering behavior—I opted for filtering based on selection, and also ensured that clearing the selection would reset all values.

To further enhance interactivity, I added a Highlight Action. Again, I went to Dashboard -\> Actions and selected Add Action -\> Highlight. I chose which sheets should act as the source and target for the highlights, and customized the settings to highlight specific dimensions that I wanted users to focus on.

To personalize the dashboard, I used various tools and techniques to adjust the layout, added titles, and formatted the dashboard to align with my data storytelling goals. I made sure the filters and highlights interacted smoothly with the visualizations by testing the interactivity.

Once everything was in place, I published the dashboard by selecting Save to Tableau Public from the File menu. I then shared the link with my class to showcase my work.

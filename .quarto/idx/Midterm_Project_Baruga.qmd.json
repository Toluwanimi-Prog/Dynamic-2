This dataset was collected through a combination of direct reporting from businesses, automated sales tracking systems, and regional sales surveys. The data encompasses a range of sales metrics, including volume and product categories, to offer insights into business performance across different types of establishments.\n\nThe dataset includes the following variables:\n\n-   Row Labels: Categories or identifiers used to organize and classify the sales data.\n-   BEER: Sales volume for beer products.\n-   DUNNAGE: Sales volume for dunnage products, which are materials used to protect goods during transportation.\n-   KEGS: Sales volume for kegs, typically used for storing and transporting beverages.\n-   LIQUOR: Sales volume for liquor products.\n-   NON-ALCOHOL: Sales volume for non-alcoholic beverages.\n-   REF: Sales volume for refrigeration supplies or products.\n-   STR_SUPPLIES: Sales volume for store supplies, which may include various retail essentials.\n-   WINE: Sales volume for wine products.\n-   Grand Total: The total sales volume across all categories combined.\n\n### Data Cleaning and Preparation\n\n1.  **Import the Data**: I downloaded and loaded the CSV file into Excel.\n2.  **Check for Missing Values**: My preferred method for handling NAs is by highlighting them and deselecting them using the filter tool for each column as I feel most thorough by doing that.

There appears to be a disporportionate amount of ***BEER*** bought for warehouses.

Recent months show higher sales for Beer and Wine.\n-   **Low Sales Categories**: Items like Dunnage and Kegs have negligible or zero sales.\n-   **Overall Total**: Total sales across all products amount to \\$2,160,899.37, highlighting overall retail activity.\n\n**Histogram of Retail Sales of Beverages Over Time**\n\n![](pivot_chart_2.png)\n\n-   Once we come to the retail side of things we see that ***WINE*** and ***LIQUOR*** are clear best sellers.

Retail sales show Liquor as the top seller, recently surpassing Wine, with Beer also performing strongly but declining. The histograms illustrate high Beer volume in warehouses and a shift in retail dominance from Wine to Liquor. Next, I will analyze seasonal trends, create advanced visualizations for deeper insights, and finalize the report with comprehensive findings and recommendations.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### Context of the Dataset\n\n-   **Title**: Warehouse and Retail Sales\n-   **Link**: [Download the CSV dataset](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/api/views/v76h-r7br/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD)\n\nThe *Warehouse and Retail Sales* dataset provides a comprehensive view of sales activities in Montgomery County, Maryland, by capturing data from various warehouse and retail operations.
